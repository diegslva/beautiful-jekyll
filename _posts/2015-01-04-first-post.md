## Rolling window with Pytorch

I always make my neural network and deep learning stuffs using numpy from scratch ( this keep my mind always usefull ) and off couse for me, better for debug.
After heavly use Tensor Flow and discover **Pytorch** I just love.
First because 95% off my models ( _actually not my but a implementation of many papers_ ) has been done from scratch ( and make my head explode many times ), see a framework make some things `easy` for you it's just like win in your birthday a box of cold beer from your girlfriend ( if you drink offcourse ).

So, when I start, first problem that I have was generate rolling windows just using pytorch (not with numpy), just with a simple line or couple of stride tricks but after read the docs I see how this was easy and pratical:

	# import torch
	import torch
	
	def pytorch_rolling_window(x, window_size, step_size=1):
        # unfold dimension to make our rolling window
        return x.unfold(0,window_size,step_size)
	
	# make a range sequence sample
	x = torch.range(1,20)
	
	# ie. window size of 5, step size of 1
	print(pytorch_rolling_window(x,5,1))

That's it ;)
