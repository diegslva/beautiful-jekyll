## Rolling window with Pytorch

I always make my neural network and deep learning stuffs using numpy from scratch ( this keep my mind always usefull ) and off couse for me, better for debug
After heavly use Tensor Flow and discover Pytorch I just love.
First because 95% off my models ( actually not my but a implementation of many papers ) has been done from scratch ( and make my head explode many times ), see a framework make some things `easy` for you it's just like win your birthday a box of cold beer from your girlfriend ( if you drink offcourse ).

So, when I start, first problem that I have was generate rolling windows just using pytorch and after read the docs I see how this was easy:
